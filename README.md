Machine Learning
================ 

### Intro
Machine learning is a subfield of computer science and statistics that deals with the construction and study of systems that can learn from data, rather than follow only explicitly programmed instructions. Besides CS and Statistics, it has strong ties to artificial intelligence and optimization, which deliver both methods and theory to the field. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit, rule-based algorithms is infeasible (YES INFEASIBLE). Example applications include spam filtering, optical character recognition (OCR), search engines and computer vision. Machine learning, data mining, and pattern recognition are sometimes conflated.

### Supervised learning, 
In the supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Spam filtering is an example of supervised learning, in particular classification, where the learning algorithm is presented with email (or other) messages labeled beforehand as "spam" or "not spam", to produce a computer program that labels unseen messages as either spam or not.

### Unsupervised Learning 
In unsupervised learning, no labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to groups of similar inputs (clustering), density estimates or projections of high-dimensional data that can be visualised effectively.[2]:3 Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end. Topic modeling is an example of unsupervised learning, where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics.

### Reinforcement Learning 
In reinforcement learning, a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle), without a teacher explicitly telling it whether it has come close to its goal or not.
